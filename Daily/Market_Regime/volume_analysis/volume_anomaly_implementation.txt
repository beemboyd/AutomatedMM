Generated: 2025-07-13 11:39:40

KEY EXHAUSTION PATTERNS IDENTIFIED:
--------------------------------------------------

HIGH VOLUME LOW MOMENTUM:
  Definition: Volume > 3x average with momentum < 5%
  Risk Level: HIGH
  Action: Consider immediate exit or very tight stop loss

VOLUME EFFICIENCY BREAKDOWN:
  Definition: Volume efficiency < 1.0 (momentum/volume ratio)
  Risk Level: MEDIUM-HIGH
  Action: Tighten stop loss, monitor closely

NARROW RANGE HIGH VOLUME:
  Definition: Volume > 2x with price spread < 2%
  Risk Level: MEDIUM
  Action: Watch for rejection, consider partial exit


RECOMMENDED EXIT RULES:
--------------------------------------------------

Volume Exhaustion Exit:
  Condition: Volume > 3x AND Momentum < 5%
  Action: Exit 50% position immediately, tight stop on remainder

Efficiency Breakdown Exit:
  Condition: Volume Efficiency < 0.5 for 2 consecutive scans
  Action: Exit full position

Narrow Range Rejection:
  Condition: Volume > 2x AND Daily Range < 1.5% AND Close near day's low
  Action: Exit at next day's open


CURRENT HIGH-RISK CANDIDATES:
--------------------------------------------------

JAGSNPHARM:
  Volume Ratio: 7.52x
  Momentum: 4.73%
  Efficiency: 0.63
  Assessment: HIGH - Volume exhaustion pattern

ANANDRATHI:
  Volume Ratio: 6.74x
  Momentum: 4.59%
  Efficiency: 0.68
  Assessment: HIGH - Low efficiency with high volume

GLENMARK:
  Volume Ratio: 8.27x
  Momentum: 18.83%
  Efficiency: 2.28
  Assessment: MEDIUM - High volume but decent momentum


IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:
--------------------------------------------------
1. Add exhaustion_score calculation to daily scanner
2. Flag tickers with score >= 3 for review
3. Auto-tighten stops for score >= 4
