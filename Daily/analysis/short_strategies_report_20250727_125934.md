5. **Liquidity:** Only short highly liquid stocks

## Implementation Considerations

- **Borrowing Costs:** Hard-to-borrow stocks have high fees

## Conclusion

Short selling strategies require careful risk management and are generally more suitable for experienced traders. The call selling approach may offer the best risk-adjusted returns but requires options trading expertise.
