| 30-40% | MILD BEARISH | 40% Long, 60% Short | Favor shorts |
| 20-30% | BEARISH | 30% Long, 70% Short | Focus on shorts |
| Below 20% | STRONG BEARISH | 20% Long, 80% Short | Aggressive shorts |

**Current Reading: 34.2% → MILD BEARISH (40% Long, 60% Short)**

- **0/3 indices above SMA20**: Strong bearish confirmation ✓ (Current)

#### Volume Check: Participation Level

- **0.30-0.50**: Normal participation - standard sizing
- **Below 0.30**: Low conviction - reduce position sizes ✓ (Current: 0.17)

## Key Insights from Correlation Analysis

### Why This Works
1. **SMA20 Breadth < 50%** has consistently preceded poor long performance
2. **Average SMA20 of 48.8%** over 4 weeks explains why shorts dominated
3. **All indices below SMA20** confirms broad market weakness

### Historical Performance Correlation
- When SMA20 breadth averaged below 50%:
  - Long strategies: ~25% win rate
  - Short strategies: ~80% win rate
- Volume participation below 0.30 indicates lack of buying conviction

## Action Plan for Next Week

Based on current readings:
1. **Allocation**: 40% Long, 60% Short
2. **Position Sizing**: Reduce by 25% due to low volume participation
3. **Focus**: Prioritize high-quality short setups
4. **Risk Management**: Tighter stops on long positions

## Regime Change Signals to Watch

Monitor these for potential trend reversal:
1. **SMA20 breadth crosses above 50%** (first warning)
2. **Any index crosses above its SMA20** (confirmation starting)
3. **Volume participation rises above 0.30** (conviction returning)
4. **Market score turns positive** (trend changing)
